# Where We Work

## Office

B&G does not have an office, but we use Capital Factory (16th floor) to meet in person and work together. We also occasionally use it to book meeting rooms if we're meeting with clients (whether in person or virtually).

## From Home

Everyone at B&G works from home. We want you to be comfortable in your element, and help reduce the ever increasing Austin traffic.

## From Coffee Shops

It might get lonely to work from home, and after some time you might start seeing cabin fever symptoms settle in. If that's the case, coffee shops are a alternative. If you want to have a partner join you but don't want to make the trip downtown to Capital Factory, don't hesitate to ask a fellow coworker to join you.
