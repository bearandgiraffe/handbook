# Welcome to Bear & Giraffe!

This document will help you get oriented on the way we do some things at B&G. Some of the items listed in this doc are optional, many are highly recommended tools, and a lot are essential to ensure a smooth operation. So please read carefully and thoroughly.

Please read through this entire doc first before performing any of the tasks. There might be things later in the doc that could help with task earlier in the doc.

## Getting Started

As a new member of the B&G team the expectations are both high and low :)
The expectations are high because we expect you to be a hustler, a doer, and a reliable teammate.
The expectations are low because we expect that you will learn everything as we go, you were chosen for your potential not for what you currently can or cannot do.

One thing we look for in everyone we work with is attention to detail. The little things matter. The B&G brand stands on being the ones who pay attention to everything and care about everything our clients might care about, even the things they don't care about.

The first test to your attentiveness will be this doc ;)

There is a lot of details included in this doc, but they are all equally important and crucial to make sure your experience at B&G goes smoothly. So please read everything carefully, we left the fluff out so that the important details don't get lost in the mix.

Don't hesitate to ask questions. We don't expect that this doc or any doc would be able to cover everything, so ask as many questions as you need. Clarity trumps the potential distraction caused by asking questions, so never ever hesitate to ask any question that might come to your mind.

Got any additions or improvements? Feel free to suggest them in a form of a PR!

## The Must-Haves

At this point you should have been assigned a B&G email where you received the link to this handbook.
That email will be used to sign in to any app or service we use. We also ask that you use that email for any communications related to the company or other B&G related functions.

You should also have received access to a Basecamp project where you can find a few to-do lists that will help you get everything setup.

The HR to-do is where you should start, if you don't complete those tasks you can't get paid :)

The Accounts to-do is all of the accounts that you need to have setup in order to perform any of the tasks required of you.

Please read the notes under each to-do item carefully, they will contain important information.

## Highly Recommended

Throughout your time at B&G but also throughout your entire digital life you will be asked to create many accounts with many sites or apps. And security is very important, so to manage all of those accounts we highly recommend the use of a password manager.

The recommended solution that we prefer is LastPass: [https://www.lastpass.com](https://www.lastpass.com) but you are welcome to use another one if you prefer.

The tools any skilled worker uses are critical, and to be productive those tools have to be well maintained, well sharpened, and well mastered. Our tool of choice in our field is our laptop. We recommend a MacBook Pro, but you're welcome to use anything you'd like (the only difference is our recommendation might be limited for other platforms).
We recommend that you setup your laptop to use multiple spaces (virtual desktop), where you'd be able to open different apps in different spaces to avoid clutter.

PS: You've been given access to a folder on G Drive called "Books" where you can download the books and read them. Please do not share them with anyone outside of the organization.

daily practice:
https://www.codewars.com
http://codekata.com/ (edited)

My recommendation is to start watching the videos, and then discuss them one by one (or each group), then move on to the books, while at the same time doing some daily practices
As you go through the daily practices, monitor the difficulty level + time it takes you to go through each one. having KPIs like that to go through is helpful to identify which areas to focus on for improvement and leveling up.
