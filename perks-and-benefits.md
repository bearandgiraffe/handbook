### Retirement Plan

Our 401K plan is through [Guideline](https://www.guideline.com). B&G matches dollar-for-dollar up to 4% of your salary that you contribute to the plan.  For instance, an employee who earns $100,000 can contribute any amount towards the 401K, however B&G will match up to the first 4% of those contributions. You are eligible to enroll in the 401K plan with your first paycheck.
